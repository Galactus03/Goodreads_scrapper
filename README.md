# Goodreads_scrapper
A scipt to scrap goodreads.com for quotes from authors, two options are avlaible : A single author can be specified  or a list of authors can be provided in a file.
A single page consists of around 19 quotes so, number of pages can be specified.
This script uses BeautifulSoup, requests and progress bar

I have commented out the multiprocessing part, if someone wants to use it he can uncomment it.
Do report any bugs you find , THank you.
